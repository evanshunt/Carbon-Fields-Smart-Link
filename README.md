# Carbon Fields Smart Link Field

This field allows you to select between internal and external links, choosing from a dropdown of Posts and Archives for internal links or manually entering a URL for external.

This repository is based on [htmlburger/carbon-fields-template](https://github.com/htmlburger/carbon-field-template).

### TODO

1. Build in logic to neatly upgrade from a text URL field, redefining such as an external link.
2. Add support for taxonomies, etc.

### Building assets

1. Edit `webpack.config.js` and make sure `const root` points to the directory where Carbon Fields are installed (e.g. `const root = path.resolve(__dirname, '../vendor/includes/htmlburger/carbon-fields');` )
1. Execute `npm install` in the root directory to install all build process requirements.
1. Execute `npm run build` to build the final minimized assets

##### Optional

Execute `npm run dev` to continuously build assets during development. Note that you should add `define( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );` to your `wp-config.php` file in order to load the files generated by the dev build process.
